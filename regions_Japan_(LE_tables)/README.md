This is collection of scripts used by me for creation of tables and maps about life expectancy in Japan for the Wikipedia page "[List of Japanese prefectures by life expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Japanese_prefectures_by_life_expectancy)" and its [Russian analogue](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Продолжительность_жизни_в_префектурах_Японии). I created also [alternative design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lady3mlnm/List_of_Japanese_prefectures_by_life_expectancy_(alternative)) of the tables to explore date from a different point of view. The data is taken from the [Japanese Mortality Database](https://www.ipss.go.jp/p-toukei/JMD/index-en.asp) > "Life expectancy at birth" tables.

I recommend at first launch the script `0_Download_data-LE_at_birth` that will download from the database the fresh data and will save them to the folder `data-LE_at_birth`.

Use online service [MapCharts](https://www.mapchart.net/japan.html) for creation maps.
